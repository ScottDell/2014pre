    Most wanted holder - A variable of which holds the value needed, for example the largest number.

    Gatherer - A variable of which keeps an accumulating effect, for example running total of values added.

    Transformation - A variable of which gets a new value from a calculation.

    Follower - A variable of which before updating a variable its current value is copied to the follower.

    Temporary - A variable of which holds some value for a short time only.



#2. Passing by value means, that when you pass a variable, which is a interger for example, into a function you pass a stored copy of that variable so unless you return that variable back out, the origional variable will stay the same.

    On the other hand if your'e passing by reference you will make changes to the origional and you will not need to return it after wards.
